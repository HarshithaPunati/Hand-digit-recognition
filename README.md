#Hand Digit Recognition

Handwritten Digit Recognition is the task of identifying digits (0-9) from images of handwritten digits using machine learning algorithms. Here's a brief summary:

Objective: The goal is to train a model to accurately predict the digit in a given image. This is commonly done using datasets like MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology), which contains 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits.

Approach:

Data Preprocessing: The images are resized and normalized to make them suitable for training.
Feature Extraction: Features from the images, such as pixel values, are used to train the model.
Model Selection: Various machine learning models, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are commonly used for this task due to their effectiveness in image recognition.
Training: The model is trained using labeled images (each image is labeled with the correct digit).
Evaluation: The model's accuracy is evaluated on a test set that it hasn't seen during training.
Applications: Handwritten digit recognition is used in fields like:

*Postal services (reading handwritten addresses)
*Banking (processing checks)
*Document automation (digitizing handwritten forms)
